# HealthEntry iPhone app.

language: Objective-C (Note: I almost wrote this app in Swift but at the time figured it was too new)

description: a simple iOS app that allows users to directly enter data into Apple's HealthKit. Different ViewControllers control views; the HealthEntryItemManager manages the HealthKit interface. SimpleHealthEntryItem and DoubleHealthEntryItem both extend the base class HealthEntryItem.
