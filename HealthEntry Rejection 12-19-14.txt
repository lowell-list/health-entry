----- 8.1 -----

We found that your app does not comply with the Guidelines for Using Apple's Trademarks and Copyrights, as required by the App Store Review Guidelines.

Specifically, your app includes inappropriate uses of "HealthKit" in the name.

For your convenience, we've provided the relevant section/s of the Guidelines for Using Apple's Trademarks and Copyrights.

Product Names Guidelines

You may use Apple, iPhone, or any other Apple word mark (but not the Apple Logo or other Apple-owned graphic symbol/logo) in a referential phrase on packaging or promotional/advertising materials to describe that the third party product is compatible with the referenced Apple product or technology, provided they comply with the following requirements.

a. The Apple word mark is not part of the product name.
b. The Apple word mark is used in a referential phrase such as "runs on," "for use with," "for," or "compatible with."
c. The Apple word mark appears less prominent than the product name.
d. The product is in fact compatible with, or otherwise works with, the referenced Apple product.
e. The reference to Apple does not create a sense of endorsement, sponsorship, or false association with Apple or Apple products or services.
f. The use does not show Apple or its products in a false or derogatory light.

In other words, whether appearing on the application itself and/or in marketing materials, the word iPhone may be used as a descriptor, but not as part of the product name.

For example, the following are acceptable:
GreatApp - with tagline "for HealthKit"
GreatApp - with tagline "HealthKit edition"
GreatApp - with tagline "HealthKit version"


The following are not acceptable:
HealthKit GreatApp
HealthKitGreatApp
